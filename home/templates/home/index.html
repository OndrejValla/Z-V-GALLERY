            <p class="artist-p mb-3">Zuzu Valla is Slovak photographer, currently living in the U.K.
                <br> Zuzu is defining her very own and recognisable signature of the photography style by
                exploring multiple layers of distinct human beauty.
                <br>She was brought up in a traditional Slovak family,
                growing up in the last years of strong communism regime and social transformation of
                Slovakia.
                <br>Zuzuâ€™s grandfather was a keen amateur photographer shooting in black and white, while her
                grandmother had been using special painting method to colour his photographs.
                <br>Zuzu started her interest in photography almost by accident in her late 20s. After being
                disappointed by using a mobile phone camera,
                she reached for her first DSLR camera and has never looked back.
                Photography had become her passion.
                <br>Zuzu is excited about capturing the moments
                where beauty, sadness and mystery come together,
                creating her unique visual signature.
